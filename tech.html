      Technology continues to evolve at lightning speed, and 2025 is poised to be one of the most
      transformative years yet. From artificial intelligence to quantum computing and sustainable
      energy solutions, tech is shaping our lives in remarkable ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      AI tools like GPT-5 and Midjourney 3 are transforming industries by enabling smarter automation,
      real-time analytics, and improved customer experiences. In healthcare, AI-assisted diagnostics
      now rival doctors in accuracy, while wearable health tech monitors everything from glucose levels
      to stress in real-time.

      Quantum computing is no longer theoretical. With commercial applications on the rise, quantum tech
      is accelerating drug discovery, cryptography, and climate modeling. Companies like IBM and Google
      are leading the charge, while startups are innovating rapidly.
    </p>

      Sustainable technology is also gaining momentum. Solar panels are now embedded in windows, and
      EV batteries charge in under 10 minutes. With increasing concerns over climate change, green tech
      investment is expected to reach $1 trillion this year alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other exciting areas include the metaverse, AR/VR developments, and brain-computer interfaces.
      While still in early stages, these tools promise to redefine communication, entertainment,
      and even consciousness itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tech in 2025 is no longer about gadgetsâ€”it's about experiences, efficiency, and empowerment.
